Dear all,

It was a pleasure to meet you all in person a few weeks ago at the NBER conference in Boston. Thank you for taking the time to speak with us at the conference. We really enjoyed learning from your whole team. 

Thank you very much, I look forward to speaking with you again soon. 

Best,
Emily
