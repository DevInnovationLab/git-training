[Verse 1]
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still, my guitar gently weeps

[Bridge]
I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

[Verse 2]
I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake, we must surely be learning
Still, my guitar gently weeps

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted, too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you

[Verse 3]
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
(I look) Look at you all
Still, my guitar gently weeps
