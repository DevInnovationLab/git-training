motto katte ni koishitari
motto kiss wo tanoshitari
wasuresou na omoide wo
sotto daiteiru yori
wasurete shimaeba

The more I fall in love for my own convenience,
the more I enjoy a kiss,
more than softly embracing the memories
that seem to be forgotten,
if I forget completely...

ima ijou sore ijou aisareru no ni
anata wa sono sukitootta
hitomi no mama de
ano kiesou ni moesou na
[wine red] no
kokoro wo motsu anata no negai ga
kanau no ni

Until now, until this, even though I'm loved,
as things appear
in your transparent eyes,
I'll hold that near-extinguished, ember-like,
wine-red heart
until your wish
is granted.

motto nando mo dakiattari
zu--tto kon'ya wo yureattari
kanashisou na kotoba ni
yotte naiteiru yori
[wine] wo agetara
------------------------------------------------------------
The more we embrace each other again and again,
shivering together throughout each and every night,
more than getting drunk
on sad-sounding words, and then crying,
if we drank wine instead...

ima ijou, sore ijou, aisareru no ni
anata wa tada hajirau yori
tedate kanakute
ano kiesou ni moesou na
[wine red] no
kokoro wo mada moteamashiteiru no sa
kono yoru mo

Until now, until this, even though I'm loved,
more than you still feel bashful--
without a way to hold it,
that near-extinguished, ember-like,
wine-red heart
is still more than I can bear
even tonight.

ima ijou, sore ijou, aisareru made
anata no sono sukitootta
hitomi no naka ni
ano kiesou ni moesou na
[wine red] no
kokoro wo utsushidashite misete yo
yurenagara

Until now, until this, until I'm loved,
in the center of
your transparent eyes,
I'll try to reflect that
near-extinguished, ember-like,
wine-red heart
while we're trembling.
